With LabyMod 4 we've improved the way to develop addons. 
You now have one project per addon; this allows you to write version-independent code in the same project as version-dependent code without needing to copy & paste the version-independent code for every version.

Here are some of the changes with our new Addon API:

* With our brand new Activity System, you can easily create and theme custom screens without needing to know how to use OpenGL
* More events for almost every occasion that behave like server-side events
* Improved way to create and use configurations
* Easy internationalization
* Mixin for bytecode manipulation in every version
* Easier setup and debugging of the addon

As of now, you'll have to manually update your `build.gradle.kts` when we update your Gradle plugin or support a new Minecraft version.
 If you want to stay up to date at any time or if you have any questions regarding our Addon API, please feel free to
